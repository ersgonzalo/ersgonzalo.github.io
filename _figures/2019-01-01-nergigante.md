A Christmas gift from Jing. A very fearsome Elder Dragon that has caused pain and suffering for many an inexperienced hunter. If you're not careful or get reckless, he will punish you and it WILL hurt. Pulled this one from a blind box with chances I have no idea about. Gacha-reward systems are popping up in more areas of my life.
