Purchased these two from my trip to Japan in 2017. I remember chatting a tiny bit with the cashier and he was trying to be really kind and tell me that there were some defects on the Nendoroids. I've collected a few others, like Joker to come next month, along with Kirito and Asuna. I used to have Ren as my Last.fm profile picture and it comes around as I've realized who he was.
