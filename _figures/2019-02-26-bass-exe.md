This Bass.exe figure is really really old. I've had this one for the longest while. I remember buying him back when I was going to a Charter School in 6th Grade. (Which would make him and astonishing 15 years old!) I would occasionally go to the toy store and then see some Megaman.exe figures in the section. I remember buying Protoman.exe, Megaman.exe, and Bass.exe. All of them were really cool, and it reminds me how much I loved the Battle Network series. 

It was a good tactical time where I could put together a "deck" of chips and then battle against friends or other Netnavis. I hope that one day in the future, if AI were to get that far, we could actually do such a thing. Bass on this hand, I've lost his Buster and just kept him and his cloak. Same thing for Megaman and Protoman...if I even have them.
