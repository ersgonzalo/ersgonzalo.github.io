Now since I'm leaving GreenSlate this Friday, this would be an especially fun post to make. These Gundams, I've taken just about an entire day to build. Over 24 hours of total time cutting the pieces, removing the excess plastic, placing the stickers, and then the decals. Personally, I don't really watch the Gundam series but it is really fun for me to build the kits. It's a ton of work but really fun for me to be meticulous about and to concentrate and focus upon. Since my previous coworker had some of his own Star Wars figures/decorations at his desk, I wanted to one-up him and get some fun detailed kits of my own. And so I further decided to keep building the kits since I loved Legos as a kid. Eventually I'd like to go many steps further and paint/detail the new ones I get.

So I had these four kits posing around keeping people entertained during my every-day. I remember a comment from another co-worker's girlfriend mentioning that the office looked boring and that my desk area was the only one that stood out. For these Gundams however, I'm not going to keep all of them. The Red Astray, I'm passing to Tom (so that I can probably rebuild another Astray with much better detailing and care). And the Freedom Gundam with it's spread wings, are going to Richard (so that I can get the Strike Freedom version with even crazier wings and poses). Weirdly enough, I still have both the Unicorn and Transparent Green Wing Gundam, despite GreenSlate being a green-coloured company. Hopefully in the future, I'll be able to pass additional kits to some coworkers or companies! Maybe even build a Perfect Grade and display it happily on my desk or another spot for others to see and occasionally play with!
