	<img class="profile-about" src="/images/about/me-header.jpg"/><p>I'm Eric Gonzalo! An alumni of Bronx Science, CUNY Baruch College, and Fullstack Academy of Code. Bits of curiousity at times; witness to amazing ongoing world events and changes, from advances in technology (*like gaming in VR*), stylish wear, musical practice, routine physical activity, and memes!</p>
	<p>Looking to find my place in the ever-expanding world as I grow each day. Less focused on myself and more on all the crazy ideas that happen around me every day! Musing about little ideas and try to shape them into better bloggity content here on the am.</p>
	<p>Dabbled varying languages that I continue to practice. Built my own computer and proud of what it's capable of, though still desiring to hit higher performance capabilities! Currently the household sre-sysadmin, learning with experimentation and implementation. Huge fan of wordplay, silly rhymes, and music.</p>

	<h4 class="break-margin">Why choose the name airy musings?</h4>

		It's wordplay that allows me to throw my thoughts out! You could interpret it in three ways:
		<ol>
			<li>Airy Musings</li>
			<li>A Musing</li>
			<li>Amusing</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It's exciting to come up with this witty name because other domain names I had in mind were taken. Lots of simple domain names were already taken and I didn't want to make a name that seemed too overbearingly annoying. A blog like this is fine with such a name and it would serve its purpose! <em>Airy</em> in the sense that the topics are a light touch upon the deep, interesting realm of things that I have played around with. <em>Musings</em> as thoughts that come out from my mind. And with even more detail:</p>
		From <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/muse" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster</a>:
		<blockquote>Muse  <span class="ssens"><strong>:</strong>  <em>to become absorbed in thought; especially <strong>:</strong>  to turn something over in the mind meditatively and often inconclusively </em></span></blockquote>
		But also according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:
		<blockquote><em>Goddesses of the inspiration of literature, science, and the arts. They were considered the source of knowledge , related orally for centuries in the ancient culture, that was contained in poetic lyrics and myths.[...] </em>			
		<em>The Muses were both the embodiments and sponsors of performed metrical speech: mousike (hence the English term "music") was just "one of the arts of the Muses". Others included Science, Geography, Mathematics, Philosophy, and especially Art, Drama, and inspiration. Some authors invoke Muses when writing poetry, hymns or epic history. The invocation typically occurs at or near the beginning, and calls for help or inspiration, or simply invites the Muse to sing through the author. </em></blockquote>
		<p>Muse is an orator that proclaims stories to the audience. I recall back in Sophomore year in Bronx Science reading great Greek Epic, The Odyssey, how muse was the one to tell of the story behind Odysseus and his travels. In relation to the naming of this website, musings are tiny tales from my own life. Though they may not be epics, these are little pieces or mini-achievements that make up a part of my life.</p>
		<p>For each of these "muses," I try to set a decent length for my thoughts to flow and for an idea to be fleshed out. There are many drafts I have yet to publish, only because it is difficult to write a whole article about certain topics, but why not try it, right?</p>
