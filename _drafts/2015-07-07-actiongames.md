Recently, I've been playing a lot of actiony-kind-of-games. For some reason, I seem to be drawn to these games where you're able to do lots of flashy moves and all sorts of cool combos. Unlike fighting games, you're up against multiple opponents and trying to utilize your abilities in defeating whatever crosses your path.

Just last week, I started playing Elsword again. Since KOG released Luciel for the North American version of Elsword, I decided to try them out. A character with dual gunblades does seem pretty cool, especially with the combo system they have in place in Elsword.
