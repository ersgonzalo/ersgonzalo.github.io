I've been a resident of New York my entire life <sup><sup>so far</sup></sup>. Lucky to have been born here and lived in such a convenient area, there's always things going on around the clock. Food, bars, cabs, games, music, shows, trains, planes, and all sorts of pass-through. Going around the city, communting through the various boroughs, there can never truly be a boring day with a little effort. (Unless you're sick, but even then you may sitll be able to find something to do!) Despite starting in Elmhurst Queens, then going to high school in the Bronx, and then to *the city* with my time in college and work, I've only experienced the tip of the iceberg of things to do!

Lucky to be friends with students who liked to do anything around the city, here are a few things that I remember. Ice Skating in Central Park/Chelsea Piers was a fun little exercise, though Central Park is only available in the winter while Chelsea is anytime. Swimming at Baruch or at a Receational Center is also a good exercise, the Rec Center in Flushing is very spacious if you're around the 7 Train Line. Bouldering at Brooklyn Boulders for a very good workout for your arms, yay for improved grip! Hiking is also possible if you check out the trails in Van Cortlandt Park, who knew such beautiful scenery was so close to the city? Restaurants on the other hand, I would recommend that you use Yelp or Foursquare to research. And there continues to be more to do as people come to find out more of their own hobbies!

Recently, after seeing more of Casey Neistat's daily vlogging, the thought of the pulsating life of New York City came back into my mind. His work is usually done within Manhattan, but he is also able to showcase the nuances within the city. Compared to other cities/towns that seem to shut down after everyone comes home from their daily jobs, you will never be turned down if you go to the right place: pizzerias that offer dollar slices to anyone, delis that provide that one thing you need at an inopportune time, bars that have drinks, buses and trains that continue to trudge through the hours.

>If I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere.  
>It's up to you, New York, New York.

Especially during my time learning, Bronx Science, Baruch College, and Fullstack, it's been another thought that New York has always been a city for opportunity. Growing up to two parents who immigrated from the Philippines, they decided to settle here because they wanted a good life for their children. Similarly, going to school with other students has shown a very similar mindset, whether it come from the parents or the students themselves. Coming from all parts of the world, China, Korea, Mexico, Canada, Germany, England, wherever, people put their faith in the decision to come to this harsh, bustling city to make a livelihood for themselves. And they aren't wrong.
