Creating content is hard. Liking, sharing and rating content is easy. Capturing a state of mind, painting the vision that you had, words that you want to say, or the dream that you want to transcribe is always difficult. It's easy for us to criticize and rag on the content that others make but what if we were in their postion?

After watching Casey Neistat's 100th video, I've come to think more about how important that the highest position is to the development of our world. Every day, we use inventions and tools that were made by people that indirectly obtained the highest part of the pyramid. Right now, I'm typing this on a Macbook, on Sublime Text, which will be sent via Git, to be hosted on Github. There are many steps that I must go through in order to publish this post.

Could this be why many people choose to go into programming? Being able to create and develop applications that may end up empowering others to be used.
