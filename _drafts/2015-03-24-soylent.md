Soylent has been making the rounds as a meal replacement that can change the way that we go about our daily routines. After being annoyed at my hungriess after being unable to prepare my own lunch before going to school and hearing some buzz behind a possible meal-replacement that will actually provide a day's worth of nutrition, I finally decided to order Soylent.

After ordering Soylent back in July, it came in December. Within that time, it seems as though the company was doing very well and continued to revise their product for the better. A very good time as I was starting Fullstack Academy very soon. I could put more focus on programming instead of worrying about what to get for the day.
