Minecraft is such a fun game to play. After having enjoyed the single player aspects, I wanted to create a multiplayer server. Why not have some friends play on the same server, witness each other's creations, and build upon each other? Everyone collaborating together towards one similar goal of creating an awesome village is not seen often! 

From the original server files, to bukkit, to spigot and sponge, there are so many ways that a player can customize their experience. With plug-ins, command blocks, and just the ability to switch to creative mode, you can create and customize the way that you go about interacting with your own world.

I've recently been playing quite often again, trying to pull out more inspiration and place it onto the world. Currently, I play on [Xenecraft](https://www.xenecraft.wordpress.com/) among friends who help share the server cost together. Right now, there seems like a good handful of us who come off and on, trying to improve the way we interact with each other.
