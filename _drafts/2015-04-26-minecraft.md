Minecraft is such a fun game to play. After having enjoyed the single player aspects, I wanted to create a multiplayer server. Why not have some friends play on the same server, witness each other's creations, 

From the original server files, to bukkit, to spigot and sponge, there are so many ways that a player can customize their experience. With plug-ins, command blocks, and just the ability to switch to creative mode, you can create and customize the way that you go about interacting with your own world.
