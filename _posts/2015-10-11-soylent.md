Soylent has been making the rounds as a meal replacement that can change the way that we go about our daily routines. After being annoyed at my hungriess after being unable to prepare my own lunch before going to school and hearing some buzz behind a possible meal-replacement that will actually provide a day's worth of nutrition, I decided to take a look at Soylent.

After ordering Soylent last year back in July, it took awhile to arrive probably due to all the increased interest from people wanting to eat "better." My batch finally came to me in December, and with that I was able to experiment with my food. Within that time, it seems as though Rosa Labs LLC (the company behind Soylent) was doing very well and continued to revise their product for the better. A very good time for me, as I was starting Fullstack Academy very soon in January. I could put more focus on programming instead of worrying about what to get for the day. While having Soylent easily accesible in the fridge, I did try to eat much less throughout the day, but I did not give up "normal" food in its entirety.

Following the instructions and getting everything prepped the night before was very quick and easy. Just as you would measure a protein shake and prepare it, the same can easily be done for Soylent:

1. Open the Soylent and pour the mix into your container
2. Fill the container half-way with water
3. Shake vigorously to get rid of clumps and powder
4. Fill up the rest of the container with water (or however much you want for its thickness)
5. Shake vigorously again
6. Enjoy now or then store it in your fridge!

I have to say that version 1.3 of Soylent that I had with oil was much better tasting than the newer more "bland" version. Though version 1.4 with everything packaged into one container is much more convenient, the taste of version 1.4 was much more mellow. The taste is still surprisingly savoury after you finish and the mix is only 500 Calories! For someone who has been trying to improve his own diet, I'd say that this can definitely fit the bill!

Though I may not have been consuming my batches as regularly, having Soylent around as another backup in case of there being no food to readily eat is wonderful. In fact, I started prepping a new batch just now, if any of ya'll are curious, I could let you have a taste of my batch! Maybe I should check out version 1.5 too and see how that can work for me...
