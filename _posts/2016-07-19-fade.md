Of slow fading dreams,  
Is a piano which gleams.  
The disappearance of each desire,  
Further down into the mire.  

A single song playing,  
Little reasons for allaying.  
Like a waltz, to and fro,  
Very much that one can show.  

And so, the final keys,  
Played gently with ease.  
Wrapping back around,  
As if leading into the ground.
