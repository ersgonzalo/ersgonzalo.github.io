Of slow fading dreams, &nbsp;  
is a piano which gleams.  
The disappearance of each desire, &nbsp;  
further down into the mire.  

A single song playing, &nbsp;  
little reasons for allaying.   
Like a waltz, to and fro, &nbsp;  
very much that one can show.   

And so, the final keys, &nbsp;  
played gently with ease.   
Wrapping back around, &nbsp;  
as if leading into the ground.
