<p>Recently, I've been playing a lot of actiony-kind-of-games. For some reason, I seem to be drawn to these games where you're able to do lots of flashy moves and all sorts of cool combos. Unlike fighting games, you're up against multiple opponents and trying to utilize your abilities in defeating whatever crosses your path. Fulfilling the young power fantasy of looking really cool by doing flashy comboed moves is always satisfying!</p>

<p>Just last week, I started playing Elsword again. Since KOG released Luciel for the North American version of <a href="https://en.elswordonline.com/" target="_blank">Elsword</a>, I decided to try them out. A character with dual gunblades does seem pretty cool, especially with the combo system they have in place in Elsword. Compared to the other characters present, the uniqueness of Luciel comes from the fact that you're playing a duo. Grinding out to the later levels, switching between characters, taking advantage of i-frames during attack animations, releasing your special attacks, and learning more about the general mechanics of the character have been ongoing with these two. Now, I'm looking forward to when they release the job advancements this coming week on the 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>Whether it be Devil May Cry, Elsword, Dynasty Warriors, Super Smash Brothers, or what have you, playing all these actiony games is so much fun. Compared to before where we were limited by smaller environments and processing power, now we're able to create huge worlds with diversity in enemies, environments, moves, and the player-characters themselves!</p>
