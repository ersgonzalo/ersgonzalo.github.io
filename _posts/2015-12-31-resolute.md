My year in review. One year is a surprisingly long time with the mundane and the repetitive. Commuting to work, exercising at the same place, eating the same food for days in a row, all done towards a long term goal. Yet the year could also pass by in the blink of an eye if you keep yourself busy, hanging with friends, hours of exercise, general passion projects, etc! Last year around a similar time, I was preparing to go to Fullstack Academy, which would only continue to change my life for the better. On this specific day, just hanging out with friends at Taco Bell and killing time for whatever the future would bring. I'm thankful and glad to have accomplished all sorts of fun things this last year.

<strong>TL;DR</strong> More swim, drum, program, style, health, games, blog.

Compare and contrast, while there where improvements, it should only be further up from here:

<h3>A Cool 2015:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Do a flip turn! Incorporating a flip turn into my normal laps with freestyle and backstroke is really fun. Swimming is fun! Hopefully it also intimidates other idiots in my lane.</li>
<li> Start taking drum lessons. I'm still a scrub that should practice though.</li>
<li> Work at a place where I can program, continue to logic out problems, and build things that can make life better.</li>
<li> Lose 50 pounds! Couldn't believe I was 210 pounds at one point earlier this year. Next goal is down to 150 pounds but man, it's weird being a small size now!</li>
<li> Get rid of old clothes that I definitely wouldn't wear anymore. Memories are nice but so are better fitting versatile clothes. <sup><sup><em>Because I lost weight, eheheheh.</em></sup></sup></li>
<li> Continue building content into my blog, learn more about templating and solidifying my knowledge with CSS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Need to 2016:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Decrease my 50 Free time down to 40 or even 30 seconds. Gotta 1-Up these kids who practice with their coaches!</li>
<li> Practice drumming more, I've been taking lessons but not practicing as much as I'd like. Gotta do a para-diddly-diddle-diddle!</li>
<li> Properly take up another programming language and become okay at it! </li>
<li> Stay more adamant about my diet/exercise, but not sacrifice so much that I can't play games! I've definitely been lacking on the game playing front since I started this regimen.</li>
<li> Keep building up my wardrobe and make sure every article works with each other, all the pieces must count!</li>
<li> Post more content on me blog, my "busyness" got in the way of posting content. I have things I could revise and put out now so that it shall be done tomorrow! Let's try for bi-weekly and continue making more content. My blog is due for another cleaner redesign too.</li>
</ul>

<small>Also, here's a random picture of a Thomas Muffins truck that I saw on the way back from somewhere in Long Island. My camera was trying to be artsy. <strike>And fix my base homepage because it seems to have broken for some reason.</strike> Because a giant unreasonable HTML file was being rendered in the front end.</small> Have a funky New Year!
