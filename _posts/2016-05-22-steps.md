Time is only passing,  
with little care for others,  
the continuous aging.  

Manage it or get lost in its passage,  
use it for others or yourself,  
there are no other choices.  

The singing of songs,  
whispering of hymns and gospel,  
writing of ideas onto a tablet,  
difficult tasks that consume the resource.  

Stepping forward against the flow,  
time cannot wait for you,  
as the world will continue change,  
what should I do?
