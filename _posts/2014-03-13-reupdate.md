Here’s to a future blog of various helpful and interesting content! Please stay tuned as I’ll be posting various experiences and thoughts to this blog. Special thanks to Bitnami, Amazon AWS, and Namecheap. For now, this will be a little test post to make sure the layout looks clear and navigable and the content will be interesting!

It's taken quite awhile for me to set up all of this and regain what should have been done earlier. Managing a website is much more work than I thought. However,  now that the semester is over, I'll be blogging a bit and throwing out ideas with hopefully-interesting content, so again, keep a lookout!
