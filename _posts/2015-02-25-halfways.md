It's been awhile since I've last written a post about something. Having my original Airy Musings website go down after becoming unable to pay for Amazon's AWS services after the micro-instance trial has left me ways away from blogging. Now that I'm halfway into my time at Fullstack Academy, this is a good opportunitiy to get back in and report on my progress! 

It's been such a wild ride learning something new every day. From the very beginning of the stack with node.js, to creating an express server, to working with mongoose models, to finally incorporating angular.js for a proper view, each thing has become a part of my arsenal of knowledge. 

Becoming operating system agnostic and becoming much more comfortable programming has been a great experience. Functionally recreating certain known applications, styling various pages a step up from CSS, and so many other various activities that I can't believe it's only been 6 weeks since I started incorporating the elements of a full stack developer into my own brain.

Scripting around with Javascript and transforming the information recieved is such fun! I'm excited to learn much more from how developers will continue change to the way that we interact with the internet.
