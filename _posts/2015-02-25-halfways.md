It's been awhile since I've last written a post about something. Having my original Airy Musings website go down — after becoming unable to pay for Amazon's AWS services within the micro-instance trial — has left me ways away from blogging. After meaning to restore my web presence for the past weeks, I decided to build up a new blog using Github pages on jekyll within my free time. Now that I'm halfway into my time at Fullstack Academy, this is a good opportunitiy to get back in and report on my progress!

It's been such a wild ride learning something every day. Each week has taught me so much more than the last, with a fair amount of stress to go along with it. Putting the huge puzzle of apis, frameworks, and languages together into a working web application has been challenging. From the very beginning of the stack with node.js, to creating an express server, to working with mongoose models, to finally incorporating angular.js for a proper view, each thing has become a part of my arsenal of knowledge. 

Becoming operating system agnostic and more comfortable programming has been a great experience. Functionally recreating certain known applications, styling various pages a step up from CSS, and so many other various activities that I can't believe it's only been 6 weeks since I started incorporating the elements of a full stack developer into my own brain.

Reviving my thought-to-be-dead Lenovo U410 made my life so much easier too! (*I'm never buying from Lenovo again because of their lack of attention to detail and open-ness.*) Instead of having to work inside of an Ubuntu VM, I could actually use the dual screened power of a laptop with its resources being wasted. Though my next laptop will probably be a macbook because of all these developer-friendly utilties I witness and learn about in Fullstack.

Scripting around with Javascript and transforming the information recieved is such fun! I'm excited to learn much more from how developers will continue change to the way that we interact with the internet.
