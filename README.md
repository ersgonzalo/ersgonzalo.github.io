Welcome to my readme page! Nothing here yet aside from the very base of my blog. I might add more content in this space but for now it will be my placeholder for future commentary!

Originally hosted on AWS and Wordpress, I migrated to jekyll and Github Pages. Due to the free one year trial ending, I decided to stick with Github pages due to being freely available.

All thoughts expressed are my own and are random musings I have!
